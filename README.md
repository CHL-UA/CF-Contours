## Project Overview

This project focuses on the statistical analysis and visualization of compound flooding (CF) risks along the Gulf Coast of the United States, particularly in the Southeast Texas and South Alabama regions. Utilizing environmental data such as precipitation, river discharge, and coastal still water levels (SWL), the code generates non-exceedance probability contours. These contours are crucial for understanding the complex interactions and dependencies among various flood drivers under current conditions and future sea level rise scenarios. This code allows for marginal distributions to be applied and for copula types tested to be customized. The best copula type is determined based on Max Log-Likelihood. Marginal distribution is based on best fit for your data, which you need to determine (Fitter Package is one option [https://fitter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://fitter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)). The path will need to be set to where you download the input files and where you want the outputs to go.

## Key Features

- **Non-Exceedance Probability Contours:** Generate empirical and theoretical contours to assess flood risks based on statistical models with various marginal distributions.
- **Sea Level Rise Scenarios:** Extend the analysis to include various sea level rise projections, aiding in resilience planning.
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis:** Utilize copulas to examine dependencies between multiple environmental variables.
